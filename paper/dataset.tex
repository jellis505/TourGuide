The training dataset for TourDruid comprises approximately 1100 images of 17 buildings across Columbia University campus. The photographs were captured by the team using 5-megapixel cameras from our smart phones and then downscaled to 0.3 Megapixels and converted into grayscale. The images were captured at many different angles and lightings to make our data set more robust.
