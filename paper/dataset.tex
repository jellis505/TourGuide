The training dataset for TourDruid comprises approximately 1100 images of 17 buildings across Columbia University campus. The photographs were captured by the team using 5-megapixel cameras from our smart phones and then downscaled to 0.3 Megapixels and converted into grayscale. The images were captured at many different angles and lightings to make our data set more robust. We chose to use our smart phone cameras to take the images for our training set since it is the same camera the application will use.

Every time a user takes a picture with our application and clicks on a result, our server saves that image and adds it to our training set.
