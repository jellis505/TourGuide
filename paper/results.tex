10-fold cross-validation on the 17-building dataset returned accuracies between 65\% and 75\% (add a table of detailed reults). These results are comparable to the original retreival accuracy on the Oxford Buildings Dataset (add actual numbers and citation), which used a 5000-image dataset of 17 buildings.
