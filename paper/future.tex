In the future, there are several improvements we would like to make to our classification algorithm. 
In particular, the classifier would be more scalable if the word frequency histogram space were quantized using a codebook like the SIFT feature space. 
An intuitive way to think about this is that one only needs a few images of an object from different angles to recognize its most striking features.
Our guess is that if we found 8 histogram cluster centers for each building, they would be from pictures taken from different perspectives, capturing necessary features while
