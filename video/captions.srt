00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is our app, TourDruid: an app to help tourists find their way around campus.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's say I'm a tourist.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't know any of these landmarks and I want to learn a little more about them.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thankfully, I have a tour guide in my pocket. (Or a TourDruid, actually.)

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So let's see how it works.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It takes you to this nice page when you open it, inviting you to start.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You click, and it presents you with a camera.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't really know what this building is. I'm going to go ahead and take a snapshot.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Here's the image we took.

10
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:36,000
Now we're going to send it, so that TourDruid can tell me what it is.

11
00:00:37,00 --> 00:00:42,000
We see an indicator telling us it's working. And note that the majority of this time is network time.

12
00:00:44,00 --> 00:00:49,000
It will present us with a list of rankings that it thinks the building is, not just one.

13
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:55,000
Hm. It seems like it thinks this is CEPSR, and seeing that little image there, I think it's right!

14
00:00:56,00 --> 00:00:59,000
So, I'm going to go ahead and confirm that, and read a little more about this building.

15
00:01:00,00 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's see.

16
00:01:01,00 --> 00:01:04,000
Huh. So it's a research facility between Pupin and Mudd,

17
00:01:04,00 --> 00:01:11,000
It has an auditorium with an 198-seat capacity, and was originally occupied by the Pegram Laboratory.

18
00:01:11,00 --> 00:01:14,000
I didn't know that. Wow!

19
00:01:14,00 --> 00:01:15,000
Where is it, though?

20
00:01:15,00 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, it's up there, indicated by a little red dot! That's amazing.

21
00:01:19,00 --> 00:01:21,000
Let's go back, and try it again.

22
00:01:19,00 --> 00:01:25,000
It seems like there's this building over there that I've never seen before.

23
00:01:19,00 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm gonna go ahead and take a picture of that one, too.

24
00:01:35,00 --> 00:01:37,000
That looks pretty good.

25
00:01:37,00 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's go ahead and send it.

26
00:01:41,00 --> 00:01:44,000
Again, the indicator's back up, and it's going to tell me what it thinks it is.

27
00:01:44,00 --> 00:01:49,000
Hm, it looks like it's NoCo, and seeing that picture, that looks right!

28
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,500
I'm gonna click it, and here's some more information.

29
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
That guy looks happy!

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Wow, this is brand new!

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,500
Amazing!

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Whoa, I didn't know that about that!

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,000
So you see, all of this information would be very helpful to a tourist. No need to wait in those silly tour groups.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And where is it? Oh, there's another red dot.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is the basic functionality of TourDruid, and we think it'll help a lot of tourists on campus enjoy themselves.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And it'll be a fun and interactive way to get along with the campus.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thanks!
